# CSchemeHW
Warnning: This project is currently a mess, currently fixing it up slowly.

CSchemeHW is mostly being written as a learning experience in lexers and interpreters. Once it's commplete, or close enough, I'll swap the lexer out for something more efficient. But that will be down the road, and when that happens I'll create a different repo for it to preserve my original handwritten efforts here.

The end goal is to have a simple, embeddable Scheme for my C projects.
